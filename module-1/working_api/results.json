Unfortunately, his family was not updated on his whereabouts and by the time we figured out the son\u2019s phone number, he was gasping for air (kinda like people do in their final moments). They were a supportive family and had not left his side for the few days prior at the smaller hospital, but when he got transferred, there seemed to have been miscommunication about where he went. When we notified them about his whereabouts, they said that they were approximately 15 minutes away. I can never explain how emotionally exhausting the ensuing 15 minutes were. This man, who was an absolutely beautiful human being, was losing his life in front of my very eyes. We were essentially giving him meds to keep his heart beating so that his family could say bye. What made it even harder was that despite this man being mentally...gone...he kept saying thank you to us when we would try to make him comfortable or give him another medication to ease his suffering. You could easily tell this man was a man of honor, humility, and dignity. When I saw his left eye start to deviate to the left, I immediately knew he was dying and he was going to let go soon. His Tele monitor looked like a mess. I put my stethoscope aside, held his hand, and just brushed his hair with my hands. I kept telling him, \u201cMy friend, your wife is coming, stay with me. She\u2019s almost here\u201d. He could no longer speak and just kept looking at me, with his left eye deviating. It was the most emotionally exhausting moments of my life. After about 10 minutes, he could no longer speak or comprehend what anyone was saying. The ICU attending was at the door crying. I was confident he would die before his family would make it. Everyone in the room just wanted him to make it to see his family. Everyone wanted his wife to say bye to him. Every single second felt like an hour, and you could see his body changing colors. You could feel death knocking at the door. At that moment, I did not feel like a doctor; I felt like a child holding his grandfather\u2019s hand. I felt lost. For so long, I am taught to save lives, and here is someone whose medical history indicates that he could easily live another 10 years.....but his body was giving up on him. After about another 10 minutes, his family made it and I left his side. His wife was in a wheelchair and she took my place and held his hands. His face brightened, and he somehow started speaking saying \u201cHello there\u201d while smiling. She replied back by saying \u201cWell hello there!\u201d also smiling. Somehow, he started speaking to her and smiling. It was so beautiful. His smile lit the room. I closed the door and curtains and gave the family their time. About 10 minutes later, he passed away with his wife\u2019s hands in his. She could not comprehend he was gone and continued talking to him. She kept patting his hands out of deep love. When I got home that night, my family told me that I physically looked like I aged 10 years. Despite it being a difficult situation, I am happy he died with her hands in his. He was happy and that\u2019s all that mattered. I will never forget his death. I learned something valuable that day that humbled me significantly; the only thing us doctors do is delay death. But ultimately, when it is your time to go, it is your time to go. I just pray I die at home, in a familiar place, with my family around.",

The day after everyone found out about that, our teacher was very tense and yelled at our class which was extremely uncommon. After that day, we never saw him at school again. \n\nWhat happened? Turns out he was grooming and seeing both the 11th grade and 12th grade students and having sex with both of them but neither knew until the 12th grader found out that the 11th grader was babysitting his daughter.

TL;DR at bottom.\n\n Senior year of high school, whenever I was sad/lonely, I would drive to the school late at night and climb up on the roof just to hang out. Super emo, I know. When I was watching Gaurdians of the Galaxy in theaters with my mom and dad, my mom got a text from her sister saying that my granddad had passed away. Not surprising, long time coming really. \n\nSo when we finished the movie, we went home and I drove to the school. It was storming pretty heavily, but I didn't mind, I like the rain. So I climbed up on the school and hung out, tried to get some cool pictures of the lightning.\n\nWhile I was getting down, I noticed some movement in the school. I stayed out of sight and saw a bunch of people in moving furniture and desks around in the lobby. Some people came out towards me, going to the fine arts building. I recognized on of their voices so I jumped down from my hiding spot and asked what was up.\n\nThey said it was the senior prank, and asked if I wanted to see what they were doing. Curious, I said sure and walked in. They had fucked up everything. Wrestling mats in the common area, trees where there shouldn't be trees, a whole staircase blocked off by desks. I looked around at all the people and realized that they were all wearing masks. So I said, \"y'all wild\" and left. \n\nNext day I didn't have class cause I dual enrolled so I didn't go to school. My mom called me, told me that our principal had called her asking about what I was doing at the school. She responded with, \"well, idk why but there's a place he likes to go when he's feeling down and his granddad died last night, Soo...\" He was very apologetic and awkwardly hung up.\n\nNext day I get called up to just reaffirm my mom's story. They didn't suspect me cause I was a good kid on most of my teachers good side, but, thought it was funny.\n\nTL;DR Was at the school late at night cause I was sad, senior prank happened to be going down, got caught on security camera, said that my granddad died.",
